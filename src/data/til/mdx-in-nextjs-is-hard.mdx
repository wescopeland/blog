There are several methods for getting MDX working with Next.js, outlined by Josh Comeau [here](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/blog/how-i-built-my-blog/).
None of them are easy, but Kent C. Dodds' [mdx-bundler](https://github.com/kentcdodds/mdx-bundler)
combined with [contentlayer](https://github.com/contentlayerdev/contentlayer) seems like a good way to go.

Contentlayer's API reminds me of Prisma, where types are auto-generated at build-time. I've used [next-mdx-remote](https://github.com/hashicorp/next-mdx-remote) on
another project which required rolling your types by hand &mdash; just a dreadful process.
