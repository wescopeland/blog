Today, I had a requirement to build a bot that could log in using an authentication form as part of a health check. Unfortunately, the form has bot detection that triggers a very complicated CAPTCHA.

There are [entire companies](https://2captcha.com/) dedicated to building APIs to programatically solve CAPTCHAs. I assume these are used mostly for nefarious purposes. Rather than take this approach, I decided a better solution might be to trick the form into thinking I'm a human so the CAPTCHA doesn't even display. After all, since this is for a health check, _the CAPTCHA appearing for a real user should signify a health check failure._

To achieve this, I utilized the [puppeteer-extra-plugin-stealth](https://www.npmjs.com/package/puppeteer-extra-plugin-stealth) package. This plugin adds multiple ["evasions"](https://github.com/berstend/puppeteer-extra/tree/master/packages/puppeteer-extra-plugin-stealth/evasions) to Puppeteer to trick servers into thinking you're not a bot. With this plugin enabled, I was able to successfully authenticate.
